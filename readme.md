# ðŸ§  Patch-Level Cancer Detection with Grad-CAM (Camelyon17)

This Streamlit app uses a ResNet18 model trained on the Camelyon17-clean dataset to detect cancerous tissue in histopathology patches. It generates Grad-CAM heatmaps for visual explainability and produces professional PDF reports for clinical interpretation.
